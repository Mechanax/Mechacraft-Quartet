			Long Overdue Fixes:

			 * Spawning completely rewritten. Animania no longer requires Spawn Limits, and there is no more Overspawning and no more Despawning.

			 * Animal agression can be turned off in the config so animals no longer attack each other 
			 * [1.11, 1.12 only] Chickens can now eat from Troughs. They like seeds and corn. You can always adjust what they eat in the config 
			 * You can now disable salt creation in the config if so desired (credit: Sunconure) 
			 * Horse meat is now an optional drop. It is off by default (credit: Sonconure) 
			 * Rolling vehicles (cart, wagon) can be disabled in the config (credit: cy4n) 
			 * [1.12 only] Dutch language added (credit: Deshiba) 
			 * Horses now require players to use the Riding Crop to mount them. Please note that this is the last version that will use the Riding Crop as we are moving to saddles in the next update.

			 * Cheese can no longer be infiintely duped when inventory full (credit: Protected) 
			 * Stack of milk bottles no longer drunk as one (credit: Luke616)

			 * Animals no longer get random mounts if below 60 world height to fix issue with skeleton farms and mounted bulls

			 This operator lets you use an input multiple times. In lambda calculus,
			 it's `\wxyz.y(wz)(xz)`. An example use of this would be
			 pipe2(Item Max Damage, Item Damage, Arithmetic Subtraction). This creates
			 an operator that tells you the damageability remaining of any given item.
			 Fixes part of #195.
			* Add the K combinator

			Changes:
			* Make network-related capability retrieval sided, this enables full compatibility with Compact Machins, Closes #420
			* Make certain aspect only update on block updates
			 Operators that depend on those values will also only update when the value updates.
			 This will result in a major performance improvement for certain networks.
			* Allow custom iteration orders to be passed to positioned addons

			Fixes:
			* Fix console spam when previewing cables in compact machines

			 * Redstone Observement
			 * Constant Definition
			 * Arithmetic Addition
		IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-0.10.3.jar:
			As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
			Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.1 or higher.

			Fixes:
			* Fix redstone writer sometimes not correctly emitting redstone values, Closes #422
			 The problem was that (redstone) capabilities could become rotated so that they would emit redstone at the incorrect side.
		IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-0.10.2.jar:
			As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
			Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.1 or higher.

			 that allow NBT subsets and supersets to be checked.
			* Add options to only move exact amounts, instead of also lower amounts, Closes #100
			* Add blacklist property to item, fluid and block-based aspects, Closes #481

			Changes:
			* Changed incorrect left-hand aspect property to right-hand, #110
