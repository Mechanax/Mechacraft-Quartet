			blockResistance (blockHardness * 5.0F) which handles resistence to
			explosions.
			An exception was made for quicksand, which initializes to the same
			hardness as minecraft:sand (0.5F) so that explosions won't leave piles
			of quicksand floating around.

			 * Don't empty the slot before you've checked if you can take from it. Fixes #49
			 * Skip slots that are blacklisted on the client side. Closes #53

			v1.13

			 * OK. container blacklisting now works properly. Added debug message when you sort a container (toggle in config gui). Also added command: /inventorysorter arg is one of: * bladd : add the last sorted container to the container blacklist * blremove: remove the last sorted container from the container blacklist * show: show the last sorted container classname * list: list the current container blacklist
			 * Actually add the blacklist config. Allows blacklisting any container you don't want to have sorting on, due to dupe issues.
			 * Try and disable mouse wheel when mousetweaks is loaded alongside.
			 * Fix slot inventory. Scrollwheel works on ItemHandlers now.
			 * Suppress warning
			 * Allow SlotItemHandler, and make canTakeStack a bit more explicit and smarter. Should make IronBackpacks, and probably many other inventories work.

			Inventory sorter changelog history

			Version 1.13.2+56 for minecraft 1.12.2

			 *
			Current release 1.13.2+56

			 * Skip slots that are blacklisted on the client side. Closes #53
			 * Fix sorting extrautils bags, and probably other bag type dupes. Note that sorting bags might still be a bad idea - it doesn't look like he prevents moving the bag on the hotbar.
			 *
			v1.13

			 * OK. container blacklisting now works properly. Added debug message when you sort a container (toggle in config gui). Also added command: /inventorysorter <arg> arg is one of: * bladd : add the last sorted container to the container blacklist * blremove: remove the last sorted container from the container blacklist * show: show the last sorted container classname * list: list the current container blacklist
			 * Actually add the blacklist config. Allows blacklisting any container you don't want to have sorting on, due to dupe issues.
			 * Try and disable mouse wheel when mousetweaks is loaded alongside.
			 * Fix slot inventory. Scrollwheel works on ItemHandlers now.
			 * Suppress warning
			 * Allow SlotItemHandler, and make canTakeStack a bit more explicit and smarter. Should make IronBackpacks, and probably many other inventories work.
			 *
			v1.12

			 * Fix changelog task. Looks like the latest versions of the plugin break the automatic generation of changelogs.
			 *
			1.10

			 * Update to 1.12.2. Fix some derpiness. Support keybindings.
			 *
			v0.11

			 * Add slot blacklisting, to just completely nuke the bloody things from orbit. Expose an IMC so other mods like pack mods can force a blacklist if another slot type proves troublesome in future.
			 * Fix furnace and brewing stand dupes.
			 * Attempt to fix baubles dupe without depending on baubles. Hope this works.
			 * Trying a fix for baubles sorting. Unsure if it'll work.

	Mob Grinding Utils (went from MobGrindingUtils-0.3.4.jar to MobGrindingUtils-0.3.6.jar):
		MobGrindingUtils-0.3.6.jar:
			* Complete re-code of the mod registries - under the hood changes that needed doing.

			* Removed legacy code using GL.11 calls that were overlooked.

			* Removed old legacy code and classes and rejigged a few bits.

			None of the changes should impact previous versions - just some house keeping.
		MobGrindingUtils-0.3.5.jar:
			* Fixed Exploding chicken feature with modded mob eggs now dropping.

			* Added Obsidian blast resistance level to the Mob Masher (safe for wither farms).

	Modular Routers (went from modular-routers-1.12.2-3.1.2.jar to modular-routers-1.12.2-3.1.5.jar):
		modular-routers-1.12.2-3.1.5.jar:
			 * Fix item dupe with Dropper/Flinger in some circumstances; cross-mod incompatibility with Realistic Item Drops and its "Dupe Workaround" disabled, which is the case in Sevtech Ages at this time ([https://github.com/DarkPacks/SevTech-Ages/issues/2649](https://github.com/DarkPacks/SevTech-Ages/issues/2649))
		modular-routers-1.12.2-3.1.4.jar:
			 * Blocks extruded by Extruder Mk1/2 now push entities along the direction of extrusion.
			 * Added Pushing Augment for Extruder Mk1/2 to increase the push force of extruding blocks. Pushing Augments can stack, and large numbers of augments can push entities a long way...
			 * Fixed Activator Module behaviour when clicking items into/out of holder blocks, e.g. Astral Sorcery Starlight Infuser, or Tinker's Construct Casting Basin.
			 * Activator Module entity mode now works on all entities, not just living entities.
			 * Improved rendering for certain blocks extruded by Extruder Mk2 (in particular blocks which connect to each other, like iron bars or glass panes)
			 * Now using a mod-local tick counter for router synchronisation instead of world tick time; should resolve router sync issues when used in conjunction with mods which modify day length or otherwise tweak server times.
		modular-routers-1.12.2-3.1.3.jar:

	PlusTiC (went from [Archived file] to plustic-6.5.2.0.jar):
		plustic-6.5.2.0.jar:

			 * Warnings will now be displayed (instead of crashing) for blocks that, because their block drop functions are implemented incorrectly, will not work with Global Traveler.
		plustic-6.5.1.0.jar:
			 * Add Thaumcraft support
			 * Update Chinese translation
		plustic-6.5.0.0.jar:
			NOTE: If you had a world with both PlusTiC and Twilight Forest enabled before this update, it is recommended that you back up that world before updating, since Twilight Forest integration has been removed from PlusTiC because Twilight Forest has added it already.

			 * Add Litherite and Erodium from Environmental Tech
			 * Fix Mirabile Visu affecting stone variants other than ordinary stone
			 * Fix broken tools with the Mana or Psicological traits sapping Mana and Psi respectively without healing; these tools will now unbreak while healing correctly

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.4.1-142.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.7-210.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.7-210.jar:
			 * Added support for Thaumcraft 6. Thaumcraft Upgrade is now craftable and adds Goggles of Revealing functionality to the Pneumatic Helmet. Aspects have been added to a few PneumaticCraft items (beyond any Thaumcraft auto-detection).
			 * The Omnidirectional Hopper and Liquid Hopper now have comparator support to measure their fullness.
			 * Logistics Drones now grab as many of the requested item type as can fit in a single item stack, instead of taking simply the first stack from the inventory.
			 * Upgrade descriptions for Pneumatic Helmet & Drones in the Charging Station GUI are now much more complete and accurate; all applicable upgrades are documented, and inapplicable upgrades are no longer shown and cannot be installed (e.g. Logistics Drones can't use Dispenser Upgrades).
			 * Particles in the Pressure Chamber are slightly less dense now, and render higher inside the chamber. Allows items in the chamber to actually be seen when the pressure is high; previously particle cloud obscured any items.
			 * Any items crafted with Air Canisters now get any air in the canister(s)
			 * Fix: Sync issue with Pressure Gauge GUI toggling the '<' / '>' button.
			 * Fix: crash with Ice & Fire Cyclops attacking Sentry Turrets
			 * Fix: dedicated server crash with drones and the Magnet Upgrade
			 * Fix: dedicated server crash when hacking mob spawners with Pneumatic Helmet
			 * Fix: client desync for Logistics Frames after configuring them with Logistics Configurator
			 * Fix: Logistics Frames & other semiblocks not always sync'ing properly to the client on initial player login
			 * Fix: items not always transferring in Logistics Network (using tubes & Logistics Modules)
			 * Fix: it's now possible to place blocks against GUI-less blocks like Compressed Iron Block without needing to sneak-right-click
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.6-192.jar:
			 * The Universal Sensor no longer uses air when the "Constant" redstone emitter mode is active (still requires minimum pressure of 0.5 bar though). Makes this block a more useful analog redstone emitter without the need for an active air supply.
			 * Fix: crash when right-clicking some PneumaticCraft blocks with other mods' wrenches
			 * Fix: another fix to Speed Upgrade crafting with stacks of more than one item in the table and CoFH-Core not installed
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.5-189.jar:
			 * Fix: crash when crafting Speed Upgrades in some situations.
			 * Fix: Gas Lift now works with infinite fluid blocks such as Better With Addons Aqueducts.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.4-186.jar:
			 * Compressed Iron Gear now added to Ore Dictionary as "gearIronCompressed". This allows Thermal Expansion Compactor to craft Compressed Iron Gears when the Gearworking Die Augment is installed.
			 * Plastic Mixer JEI page now uses Ore Dictionary to show the dyes instead of hard-coded vanilla dye items. (Mods and/or packs can remove vanilla dyes from the oredict so hardcoded items can be misleading)
			 * Fix: client crash when looking at RFTools Powercells with the Pneumatic Helmet Block Upgrade Tracker active (and RF scanning enabled). The RF scanner still doesn't get the RF level; a more comprehensive data syncing framework for the Pneumatic Helmet is being considered.
			 * Fix: Removed Upgrade Info tab from Refinery GUI (the block doesn't take any upgrades)
			 * Fix: Nasty item-equip sound loop being player when Pneumatic Helmet equipped and Charging Station GUI open
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.3-181.jar:
			 * Fix: Shift-click dupe bug (introduced in 0.6.0) when clicking items into some PneumaticCraft inventories.

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.2-179.jar:
			 * Fix: Server crash when Spawner Agitators are used in conjunction with the Despawning Spawners mod.
			 * Fix: Omnidirectional Hoppers now respect the sidedness of the block they pull from (e.g. will no longer pull input items or fuel from the bottom side of a vanilla furnace).
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.1-176.jar:
			* Fix: Crash with liquid lookup with JEI.
			* Fix: Drones being quirky sometimes when digging.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.0-174.jar:
			* Added Harvesting Drone, and Harvesting Piece.
			* QoL improvement: Speed Upgrades can now be crafted with fluid containers holding more than a bucket of lubricant. The Liquid Hopper works for this, and the Thermal Expansion and EnderIO tanks can also be used. Other mods' containers may also work.
			* QoL improvement: adding extra Refinery blocks to an existing stack will now automatically redistribute any output fluids to the appropriate tanks, so the Refinery can continue to run. E.g. adding a Refinery to a 2-block stack which already contains Diesel and LPG will auto-move the LPG from the second to the third (newly added) block.
			* Programmable Controller: all faces except the bottom face can be used to access the fake drone's inventory. The bottom face can be used to insert or extract the programmable item (Drone or Network API).
			* QoL improvement: Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now only accepts items/fluids that can be used in recipes.
			* Fix (cosmetic): Amadron no longer shows slot highlights where there isn't a trade widget (i.e. on the last page of trades).
			* Fix: Breaking any PneumaticCraft tile entity with an auto-smelt pick (e.g. from Tinker's Construct) no longer smelts the tile entity's contents.
			* Fix: MCMP2 support hard-disabled for now (switching it on in config would crash your game before)
			* Fix: Elevator Caller now works properly when you have more than 12 floors
			* Fix: Programmable Controller inventory handling now works properly (inventory manipulation widgets were accessing the controller's 1-slot inventory instead of the fake drone's inventory)
			* Fix: Removing the programmable item (Drone or Network API) from the Programmable Controller's slot now properly stops and resets the running program.
			* Fix: Rotating PNC blocks with other mods' wrenches should no longer also open the block's GUI.
			* Fix: The Charging Station now only allows 1 item to be inserted, to prevent duping Machine Upgrades.
			* Performance: fluid tank rendering now uses a FastTESR, better for client FPS.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.5.1-163.jar:
			* Drones now also render held hoes upside down (just like other tools).
			* Fixed the Programmable Controller since the initial port (most notably a crash involving FTB Utilities).
			* Inserting/extracting the top side of the Programmable Controller block inserts/extracts "drone" inventory.
			* Fix server crash with Mekanism cardboard box & spawner agitator
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.5.0-159.jar:
			 * Added GPS Area Tool, a way to make selecting areas with the Programmer easier.
			 * You can 'paste' Coordinate puzzle pieces in the Programmer by taking a GPS Tool and left-clicking it on the programming area (the GPS Area Tool does the same for the Area piece).
			 * Drones & Logistics Drones can now be spawned from a Dispenser
			 * Altered camera orientations for some held items (wrenches & other tools - thanks Teamspen210)
			 * Oil worldgen can now be blacklisted by dimension ID (e.g. disable oil generation in Twilight Forest) - see I:oilWorldGenBlacklist in pneumaticcraft.cfg
			 * RF Import & RF Export programming pieces are now available (they were in, but registration was getting skipped due to a bug). Also note that despite the name, these pieces work with Forge Energy, which is RF-compatible.
			 * Gas Lift air (pressure) usage when extending the tube is now dependent on the hardness of the block being broken (stone is the same, softer blocks are cheaper, and obsidian is much more expensive to break)
			 * Advanced Pressure Tubes can now be used in the Gas Lift, and will reduce the pressure cost to break blocks to 50%
			 * The Spawner Agitator is now found 10x less frequently in dungeon loot chests (it can still be crafted, though)
			 * Fixed a crash with the Amadron Tablet when adding a trade when not having a item supply location bound to the tablet
			 * Fixed Drones sometimes refusing to teleport while they should (most likely to notice with Place Block commands)
			 * Fixed entity filters in Pneumatic Helmet entity tracker module not working on dedicated servers
			 * Reworked some event handling code which should provide a significant performance improvement in worlds with many loaded tile entities
			 * Hopefully fixed server-side NPE with Programmable Controller and FTB Utilities claim protection
			 * Fixed Gas Lift being able to break unbreakable blocks (bedrock, ender portal frames...)

	Tesla Core Lib (went from Tesla Core Lib : 1.12 - 1.0.12 to Tesla Core Lib : 1.0.14.10):
		Tesla Core Lib : 1.0.14.10:
			- updated for latest recommended forge 1.12.2 version
		Tesla Core Lib : 1.0.13.8:
			- fixed problem with conflict between 'allowMachinesToSpawnItems' and tesla wrench picking up tile entities
			- added pt_BR translation
			- fixed issue #31: [https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/Tesla-Core-Lib/issues/31](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/Tesla-Core-Lib/issues/31)
			- updated to latest buildcraft api
			- removed a bit of log spam

			- moved to MMD servers
			- jar should now be signed

	The Lost Cities (went from lostcities-1.12-2.0.3.jar to LostCities - 1.12-2.0.9):
		LostCities - 1.12-2.0.9:
			 - Fixed a crash bug in combination with the Aroma Mining Dimension
		LostCities - 1.12-2.0.8:
			 - Added support for multiple Lost City dimensions through the new ADDITIONAL_DIMENSIONS config. These dimensions are not accessible with the usual method. They are mostly intended for pack devs who need multiple city dimensions with various properties (profiles)
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.7.jar:
			 * Added a new config option ('blocksRequiringLightingUpdates' in general.cfg) that lists all blocks that require a lighting update. By default it contains glowstone, lit_pumpkin and magma but you can add modded blocks to it. Meta is not required
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.6.jar:
			 * Fixed a small bug where predefined cities would not generate if the sphereChance is too low
			 * Fixed getShere() in the api so that it returns null if there is no sphere instead of a dummy sphere that is not enabled. That fixes an issue with the 'insphere' command in In Control
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.5.jar:
			 * The spawnSphere <out> setting wasn't working properly. Additionally it was impossible to spawn in the outside world on a biosphere world because it restricted spawn height to above 60 (and default ground level is 40)
			 * Better crash log entry in case the client is not having a profile that the server is using
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.4.jar:
			 * More fixes for sponge compatibility

	The One Probe (went from theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.19.jar to TheOneProbe - 1.12-1.4.23):
		TheOneProbe - 1.12-1.4.23:
			 - Compatible with the latest version of McJtyLib (for big power api)
			 - Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
			 - Added the word ?level? to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.23-alpha.jar:
			- Fixed a bug where the one probe would show if a stone block contains a silverfish
			- Added the word ‘level’ to the TOP info when a block cannot be harvested to hopefully lessen confusion with this
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.22.jar:
			Enhancements:

			 * Show the bucket texture for fluids when it exists (josephcsible)
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.21.jar:
			 * Joseph fixed a bug with REALLY big energy containers
			 * McJty made sure TOP no longer crashes in case rendering an item crashes (like some items from bibliocraft seem to do). It will report an 'error' message instead
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.20.jar:
			New features:

			 * Added TESLA support
			 * Added support for the new large power cell from RFTools Power (McJty)
			 * Item frames now display their item
			Enhancements:

			 * Drawers from Storage Drawers Extras now show their contents by default, like drawers from Storage Drawers already did
			 * Improved the error message when another mod doesn't implement capabilities correctly
			Bug fixes:

			 * Fixed item frames, paintings, and leads rendering in the wrong position
			And lots of refactoring and code cleanup.

	The Twilight Forest (went from Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.6.345 to Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.7.424):
		Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.7.424:
			ADDED:

			 * We split the progression into three separate lines, meaning that instead of clearing one dungeon and moving to the next in line, you now have the choice after defeating the Lich to go to the Hydra, Ur-Ghast, or Aurora Palace first.
			 * Defeating all three is still necessary to gain access to the Highlands.
			 * Tinkers' Construct integration!
			 * Added Tinker's Construct Integration with Naga Scales, Steeleaves, Fiery Ingots, Knightmetal Ingots, and Raven's Feathers to make materials & tools out of.
			 * Added unique traits for each material:
			 * Twilit appears on all Twilight Forest materials, meaning your tool gains +2 speed in the Twilight Forest and deals +2 damage in any other dimension.
			 * Precipitate appears on Naga Scale materials, it lets you use the tool quicker with the lesser health on your Player.
			 * Synergy appears on Steeleaf materials, it will passively repair the tool if you have Steeleaf in your hotbar. The more Steeleaves you have in the hotbar, the faster it repairs.
			 * Stalwart appears on Knightmetal materials, it will make you more resilient in combat.
			 * Veiled appears on Raven's Feather materials, it will render arrows invisible.
			 * Baubles integration!

			 * All charms can now be used in the off-hand and also equipped in the Baubles inventory.
			 * All tiers of the Charm of Keeping will keep the Baubles Inventory.
			 * Thaumcraft Compat: Live & Reloaded! All items and blocks (aside from unobtainable and some WIP items) now have aspects.
			 * Added a config option to make the Portal creation lightning not cause fires, disable it if you're against pyromania derrived fun.
			 * Made a new potion effect for the ice render effect from Ice Bombs, Ice Bow, etc. instead of putting it on the Slowness effect.

			 * This also stops ice getting applied getting the slowness effect under certain conditions.
			 * The Block and Chain now disables shields like an axe.
			 * Added config option for players spawning for the first time to spawn in the Twilight Forest. Off by default.
			 * Added config option to make Twilight Portals create a blocked-off portal at their destination. Toss in the activation item to unblock the portal. Off by default.
			 * Added recipes where Iron armor and tools can be crafted directly into their Fiery counterparts.
			 * Added Shield-Parrying for all Twilight Forest Projectiles. Installing [Shield Parry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/parry) mod causes Twilight Forest to skip its parrying methods.
			 * Updated the Japanese language file.
			 * Updated the Chinese language file.
			 * The Russian language file now covers everything in the mod.
			CHANGED:

			 * Changed the Creative menu icon to the Miniature Portal item.
			 * The advancements Past the Thorns and So Castle Very Wow now have a [NYI] tag in their names to signify they are not functional yet.
			 * All tiers of the Charm of Keeping now preserve items in the off-hand slot.
			 * Charm of Keeping usage now drops any items that would be overwritten by an item saved to prevent item loss if something is put in the player's inventory.
			 * Code Improvements for Naga Courtyard.
			FIXED:

			 * Magic Maps now properly update after switching Dimensions
			 * The Zombie Scepter no longer joins its zombie kind by destroying itself at 0 durability.
			 * Special leaves in Twilight Forest are now using the ore dictionary properly. (This totally wasn’t solved previously and went undocumented we swear.)
			 * Ore magnet no longer checks ModID in the registry string.
			 * Mazestone and its variants once again consume 16 durability from your mining tools when mined.
			 * Castle Doors no longer have their texture broken.
			 * Charm of Life effect upon death now uses the correct sprite.
			 * Improved algorithm for the Miner's Tree, it should be less confused and stuck when trying to pull ores from the ground.
			 * Fixed some blocks missing getBlockFaceShape overrides, causing glass panes, fences, walls, etc. to connect to blocks when they shouldn't.
			 * Fixed the placement problems with Spiral Bricks and took off the [WIP] tag.
			 * Finally fixed texture and UV problems with Knightly Armor and Phantom Armor; rejoice!
			 * Ur-Ghast's tears should be visible again in Multiplayer when it's throwing a tantrum.

	Thermal Cultivation (went from ThermalCultivation-1.12.2-0.1.5.3-universal.jar to ThermalCultivation-1.12.2-0.3.0.7-universal.jar):
		0.3.0:
			GENERAL:

		0.2.0:
			ADDED:
				-Watering Cans can now be colored.
					There will be an item coming later to better facilitate this. Dyes work though!

			GENERAL:
				-Lots of backend work to support new features.

	Thermal Expansion (went from ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.3.10.15-universal.jar to ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.5.0.29-universal.jar):
		5.5.0:
			GENERAL:
				-We've updated our privacy policy.*

				-Lots of new config options. These in particular are notable:
					The number of Augment Slots for Dynamos and Machines can be set for each level.

					There is a config option to disable upgrade functionality. This only applies to in-world
					upgrades.

					The Fisher and Tapper can be configured to *require* bait or fertilizer to produce stuff.

				-Lots of Plugin updates.
				-JSON-Based Content Addition System.
					This can be considered partially complete - not all Machines are supported, and not all
					recipe styles are supported either. Some hardcoding is required due to the strange way that
					Minecraft deals with certain items. Lookin' at you, Potions.

					There will be more on this later and the website will be updated with the default content
					files and examples. But basically, you can add/overwrite a lot of default recipes and fuels
					in the mod, and set the "Oredict" defaults for many outputs. Removal is currently not
					supported.

					So, if you don't agree with some particular value in TE, you might be able to change it now!

			ADDED:
				-New Augment:
					-Agitating Manifold (Compression Dynamo): greatly improves power output	and efficiency when
						using Refined Biofuel - "Grassoline".
				-New Device:
					Vacuumulator. It sucks up items in an area and has configurable filtering.

				-Biofuel processing line. You'll need a Sawmill.
				-GUI Tooltips for Dynamo Fuels; values are specific to *that* Dynamo, including augs/coolant.
				-Reservoirs now render the fluid contained within.

			CHANGED:
				-Coolants and Fuels have been rebalanced a bit. This includes a substantial "nerf" to Tree Oil.
				-Item Allocator now has configurable filtering to determine what it will accept/transfer. :)
				-Some processing recipes have been adjusted.

			FIXED:
				-Dye removal recipes have been fixed for the Reservoir.

			*We don't have a privacy policy. This is a joke. There is no telemetry  or data mining/scraping in
				any CoFH mod.
		5.4.2:
			GENERAL:
				-Backend work and migration of some files to CoFHCore.
				-IMC Handling has been adjusted to support the new Compactor framework.

			ADDED:
				-Some Specialization Augments can now be explicitly disabled if you wish to effectively prevent
					or gate those particular machine functions.

			FIXED:
				-Coloration recipes have been tweaked slightly in code. Enchanted items are now dyeable.
				-Item enchanting is a bit more consistent in what should apply.
		5.4.1:
			GENERAL:
				-Inventory Tweaks support has returned to Satchels.

			ADDED:
				-Improved EvilCraft plugin support.

		5.4.0:
			ADDED:
				-New Devices:
					Factorizer. It performs storage conversions!
					Creature Encaptulator - Uses Morbs to catch mobs. :)

				-Capacitors, Reservoirs, and Satchels can be colored.
					There will be an item coming later to better facilitate this. Dyes work though!

				-Capacitors and Reservoirs now work in Bauble slots.

				-More plugin support. Astral Sorcery, Ender IO, Thaumcraft, and others.

			CHANGED:
				-Capacitor modes have been changed! The new modes are:
					-Charge Equipment (Held Items, Worn Items, Baubles)
					-Charge Inventory
					-Charge All
				-Elemental Dust recipes have changed slightly :)
				-The Compactor no longer has a storage mode or Modes at all. Augments now change the default
					operation of the device.
				-Potions can now only be refined to Level 4. The vanilla game just had too many edge cases with
					level 5 effects.
				-Sawmill costs have been reworked substantially. Some "recycling" recipes have been moved to
					the Pulverizer. Others have been removed entirely.
				-Sawmill recipe has been changed.

			GENERAL:
				-Lots of backend work and refactoring. Like, a lot.
				-There has been a LOT of work done on a json recipe system. It's not 100% ready at this time
					so isn't available yet for open config. But that's coming. Still fleshing it out.
				-Various XP Fluids are automatically unified in the Arcane Ensorcellator.

		5.3.12:
			CHANGED:
				-Adjusted insertion and extraction logic from various machine tanks.
				-Potion refining now produces a bit more at each level, ending at 100 mB for level 5.
		5.3.11:
			GENERAL:
				-Internal refactors and optimizations.

			ADDED:
				-New Augments:
					Clastic Deposition - Allows the Igneous Extruder to make sand and gravel.

				-New machine process recipes.
				-Lots of new Plugin support.

				-New Config Options:
					Energy Scale factor for Machines. It's advanced. Be sure you know what you're doing.
					Disable Auto-Input and Auto-Output for Machines and Devices
					Decoctive Diffuser can have its range adjusted for different Potion fluids.

			CHANGED:
				-Decoctive Diffuser has had its base radius doubled.
				-Minor recipe adjustments.

			FIXED:
				-Machine recipes and JEI categories have been decoupled.
				-Minor change to Insolator OreDict logic to prevent other mods from sabotaging it.

	Thermal Foundation (went from ThermalFoundation-1.12.2-2.3.10.6-universal.jar to ThermalFoundation-1.12.2-2.5.0.19-universal.jar):
		2.5.0:

				-Horse armors in various metals.
				-Pyrotheum-based crafting table recipes for Hardened Glass.

				-CTM support for Hardened Glass.
				-Wrench support for Buildcraft and EnderIO.

			CHANGED:
				-Default worldgen files have been altered to use properties instead of metadata.
				-Holding a Redprint or Signalum Security Lock in your offhand will automatically attempt to use
					it when placing a block supporting those features.

			FIXED:
				-Various recipes now use sticks and not strings. Woops.

		2.4.1:
			GENERAL:
				-Just some backend stuff. Ignore the unused Horse Armor textures for now. ;)

		2.4.0:
			ADDED:
				-New item: Pigments. They're generic dyes in the basic 16 colors.

			CHANGED:
				-Elemental Dust recipes have changed slightly :)
				-Sneaking while using certain AoE tools temporarily disables the AoE.
				-CoFH World is no longer a HARD dependency. You better be real sure you know what you're doing
					before you remove it or opt to not use it though. :)

			GENERAL:
				-By default, all Thermal mods will now share some common Creative Tabs. You can disable this
					option if you like.
				-Lots of backend work to support new features.

		2.3.12:
			FIXED:
				-Fluids should properly sync with the server in all cases.

		2.3.11:
			GENERAL:
				-Minor adjustment to prevent Forge derpiness with multiple Steams.
