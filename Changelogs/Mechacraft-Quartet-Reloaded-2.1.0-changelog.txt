			- Fixed using right click to add items leaving client artifacts behind.

	Quark (went from Quark-r1.5-151.jar to Quark-r1.5-152.jar):

			 * Operator: Light Level is now the combined light level
			 * Hail Particle changes (Dudblockman)
			 * Update to LibLib 4.1.8
			Known Bugs:

			 * Flowsuit still borked

	Spartan Shields (went from SpartanShields-1.12.2-1.5.3.jar to SpartanShields-1.12.2-1.5.4.jar):
		SpartanShields-1.12.2-1.5.4.jar:
			 *  Hotfix: Fixed recipes for vanilla shields which wouldn't load if the "Vanilla Only" config is set to true (fixes issue #33)
			Changes in version 1.5.3:

			 * Hotfix: Shield Bashes are now bound to the Attack Keybind while Blocking, rather than just Left Click while Blocking (fixes issue #29)
			This is to fix an issue when the Use Item Keybind and Attack Keybind were swapped, which prevented the Shield Bash from occurring.
			 * As a result of the above, Tooltips now reflect the current Attack Keybind required to execute a Shield Bash
			 * Tweak: Shield Bashes now consume 5 durability per bash.
			 * New config option to disable Standard Shields which have Tower Shield counterparts (suggested by issue #30)
			Changes in version 1.5.2:

			 * Hotfix: Fixed Model Render Registry attempting to load up a Shield Item that is null, causing a crash. (Fixes issue #28)
			Changes in version 1.5.1:

			 * Hotfix: Fixed the loading order to load after all optional mods, especially since Thaumcraft normally loads *after* Spartan Shields, which causes a crash. (Fixes issue #25)
			 * Added French translations! Special thanks to Neerwan for providing them.
			 * Removed redundant translation files, which were intended for the 1.13.2 version of the mod. Oops.
			 * Rearranged code to ensure that Shields items are created on the Item Registry Event rather than immediately. This is another measure to prevent crashes with Thaumcraft loading after Spartan Shields.
			Changes in version 1.5.0:

			 * Added a Shield Bash to all Shields in this mod! You can use this by Blocking then pressing Left-Click. It does little damage but is good for knocking back enemies when you are dealing with groups of them.

			 * Shields now accept the Knockback enchantment which affects knockback when Shield Bashing
			 * The Dark Steel Riot Shield returns at last! It has been updated to make use of the Micro Infinity power unit.
			 * Introducing two new Shield materials from Thaumcraft: (suggested by issue #21)
			 * Thaumium Plated Shield
			 * Void Plated Shield
			The Void Plated Shield has the Warping effect that Void items do in Thaumcraft and also regenerates it's durability.
			 * Introducing Tower Shields: They can have Banners applied to them just like the vanilla Shield
			Available in all Vanilla materials, including Obsidian, and the common modded materials too
			Not available in the specialised mod materials, e.g. Botania, Thermal Foundation, Thaumcraft, etc.
			 * Fixes:
			 * The Spikes Enchantment now shows up in the Spartan Shields Creative Tab
			 * The Embers misleading tooltip compatibility issue has finally been fixed. (fixes issue #13)
			 * Shields now use the isShield() method now instead of the custom one used beforehand. This allows compatibility with Angel of Vengeance and Shield Parry (Fixes issue #20)
